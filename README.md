# MagicSquare
Magic Square generator

Creates three unique magic squares of input size. Size is limited to an odd number between 3-15. The algorithm implemented is the Siamese
method for generating magic squares: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siamese_method. This code would
function properly for any odd number if the limit did not exist.
